        \\ provide all such future investors other contractual terms such as registration rights,
    the <Company> shall provide substantially equivalent rights to the Purchasers with respect to the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> (with appropriate adjustment for economic terms or other contractual rights), subject to such Purchaser's execution of any documents, including, if applicable, investor rights, co-sale, voting, and other agreements, executed by the investors purchasing securities in the <Next Financing> (such documents, the ""Next Financing Documents""). Any <Major Purchaser> will remain a <Major Purchaser> for all purposes in the <Next Financing Documents> to the extent such concept exists. The <Company> shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses, not to exceed $5,000 in the aggregate, of 1 counsel for the Purchasers in connection with the Purchasers' review, execution, and delivery of the <Next Financing Documents>. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to the provisions of {Termination}, upon the execution and delivery of the <Next Financing Documents> by <Purchasers> holding a majority of the then-outstanding shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> held by all <Purchasers>, the <Agreement> (excluding any then-existing and outstanding obligations) shall be amended and restated by and into such <Next Financing Documents> and shall be terminated and of no further force or effect.
    Assignment of Company's Preemptive Rights \\ The <Company> shall obtain at or prior to the <Initial Closing>, and shall maintain, a right of first refusal with respect to transfers of shares of <Common Stock> by each holder thereof, subject to certain standard exceptions. If the <Company> elects not to exercise its right of first refusal with respect to a proposed transfer of the <Company>'s outstanding securities by any <Key Holder>, the <Company> shall assign such right of first refusal to the <Major Purchasers>. In the event of such assignment, each <Major Purchaser> shall have a right to purchase that portion of the securities proposed to be transferred by such <Key Holder> equal to the ratio of
        \\ the number of shares of the <Company>'s <Common Stock> issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> owned by such <Major Purchaser>, to
        \\ the number of shares of the <Company>'s <Common Stock> issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> owned by all <Major Purchasers>.
    Reservation of Common Stock \\ The <Company> shall at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the conversion of the <Series Next Preferred Stock>, all <Common Stock> issuable from time to time upon conversion of that number of shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> equal to the <Total Shares Authorized for Sale>, regardless of whether or not all such shares have been issued at such time.
Restrictions on Transfer; Drag Along \\
    Limitations on Disposition \\ Each person owning of record shares of <Common Stock> of the <Company> issued or issuable pursuant to the conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> and any shares of <Common Stock> of the <Company> issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect thereto or in exchange therefor or in replacement thereof (collectively, the ""Securities"") or any assignee of record of <Securities> (each such person, a ""Holder"") shall not make any disposition of all or any portion of any <Securities> unless:
        Effective Registration Statement \\ there is then in effect a registration statement under the <Securities Act>, covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement; or
        Notice of Circumstances \\ such <Holder> has notified the <Company> of the proposed disposition and has furnished the <Company> with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and, at the expense of such <Holder> or its transferee, with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the <Company>, that such disposition will not require registration of such securities under the <Securities Act>.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of {Effective Registration Statement} and {Notice of Circumstances}, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel will be required:
        \\ for any transfer of any <Securities> in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or
        Investment Fund Internal Transfers \\ for any transfer of any <Securities> by a <Holder> that is a partnership, limited liability company, a corporation, or a venture capital fund to
            \\ a partner of such partnership, a member of such limited liability company, or stockholder of such corporation,

    provided that, in the case of {Investment Fund Internal Transfers} and {Gratis Transfers}, the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of the <Agreement> to the same extent as if the transferee were an original <Purchaser> under the <Agreement>.
    "Market Stand-Off" Agreement \\ To the extent requested by the <Company> or an underwriter of securities of the <Company>, each <Holder> shall not sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any <Securities> or other shares of stock of the <Company> then owned by such <Holder> (other than to donees or partners of the <Holder> who agree to be similarly bound) for up to 180 days following the effective date of any registration statement of the <Company> filed under the <Securities Act>; provided however that, if during the last 17 days of the restricted period the <Company> issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the <Company> occurs, or before the expiration of the restricted period the <Company> announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the restricted period, and if the <Company>'s securities are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 2711 thereof applies, then the restrictions imposed by {"Market Stand-Off" Agreement} will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event; provided, further, that such automatic extension will not apply to the extent that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has amended or repealed NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), or has otherwise provided written interpretive guidance regarding such rule, in each case, so as to eliminate the prohibition of any broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association from publishing or distributing any research report, with respect to the securities of an "emerging growth company" (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012) before or after the expiration of any agreement between the broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association and the emerging growth company or its stockholders that restricts or prohibits the sale of securities held by the emerging growth company or its stockholders after the initial public offering date. In no event will the restricted period extend beyond 215 days after the effective date of the registration statement. For purposes of this {"Market Stand-Off" Agreement}, "<Company>" includes any wholly-owned subsidiary of the <Company> into which the <Company> merges or consolidates. The <Company> may place restrictive legends on the certificates representing the shares subject to {"Market Stand-Off" Agreement} and may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the <Securities> and such other shares of stock of each <Holder> (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period. Each <Holder> shall enter into any agreement reasonably required by the underwriters to implement the foregoing within any reasonable timeframe so requested.
    Drag Along Right \\ If a "<Deemed Liquidation Event>" (as defined in the <Restated Charter>, a ""Deemed Liquidation Event"") is approved by each of
        \\ the holders of a majority of the shares of <Common Stock> then-outstanding (other than those issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock>),
        \\ the holders of a majority of the shares of <Common Stock> then issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> then-outstanding and
        \\ the <Board>,

The obligation of any party to take the actions required by {Drag Along Right} will not apply to a <Deemed Liquidation Event> if the other party involved in such <Deemed Liquidation Event> is an affiliate or stockholder of the <Company> holding more than 10% of the voting power of the <Company>. ""Stockholder"" (collectively, ""Stockholders"") means each <Holder> and <Key Holder>, and any transferee thereof.
    Exceptions to Drag Along Right \\ Notwithstanding the foregoing, a <Stockholder> need not comply with {Drag Along Right} in connection with any proposed sale of the <Company> (the ""Proposed Sale"") unless:
        \\ any representations and warranties to be made by the <Stockholder> in connection with the <Proposed Sale> are limited to representations and warranties related to authority, ownership and the ability to convey title to such <Shares>, including representations and warranties that
            \\ the <Stockholder> holds all right, title and interest in and to the <Shares> the <Stockholder> purports to hold, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances,
            \\ the obligations of the <Stockholder> in connection with the transaction have been duly authorized, if applicable,
            \\ the documents to be entered into by the <Stockholder> have been duly executed by the <Stockholder> and delivered to the acquirer and are enforceable against the <Stockholder> in accordance with their respective terms and,
            \\ neither the execution and delivery of documents to be entered into in connection with the transaction, nor the performance of the <Stockholder>'s obligations thereunder, will cause a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement, law, or judgment, order, or decree of any court or governmental agency;
        \\ the <Stockholder> will not be liable for the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any other individual, corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company, association or other entity (a ""Person"") in connection with the <Proposed Sale>, other than the <Company> (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties, and covenants of the <Company> as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties and covenants provided by all stockholders);
        \\ the liability for indemnification, if any, of the <Stockholder> in the <Proposed Sale> and for the inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by the <Company> or its <Stockholders> in connection with such <Proposed Sale>, is several and not joint with any other <Person> (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the <Company> as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties, and covenants provided by all stockholders), and except as required to satisfy the liquidation preference of the <Series Next Preferred Stock>, if any, is pro rata in proportion to, and does not exceed, the amount of consideration paid to such <Stockholder> in connection with such <Proposed Sale>;
        \\ liability will be limited to the <Stockholder>'s applicable share (determined based on the respective proceeds payable to each <Stockholder> in connection with the <Proposed Sale> in accordance with the provisions of the <Restated Charter>) of a negotiated aggregate indemnification amount that applies equally to all <Stockholders> but that in no event exceeds the amount of consideration otherwise payable to the <Stockholder> in connection with the <Proposed Sale>, except with respect to claims related to fraud by the <Stockholder>, the liability for which need not be limited as to the <Stockholder>;
        \\ upon the consummation of the <Proposed Sale>,
            \\ each holder of each class or series of the <Company>'s stock will receive the same form of consideration for their shares of such class or series as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same class or series of stock unless the holders of at least a majority of <Series Next Preferred Stock> elect otherwise,
            \\ each holder of a series of <Series Next Preferred Stock> will receive the same amount of consideration per share of such series of <Series Next Preferred Stock> as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same series,
            \\ each holder of <Common Stock> will receive the same amount of consideration per share of <Common Stock> as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of <Common Stock>, and
            \\ unless the holders of at least a majority of the <Series Next Preferred Stock> elect to receive a lesser amount, the aggregate consideration receivable by all holders of the <Preferred Stock> and <Common Stock> shall be allocated among the holders of <Preferred Stock> and <Common Stock> on the basis of the relative liquidation preferences to which the holders of each respective series of <Preferred Stock> and the holders of <Common Stock> are entitled in a <Deemed Liquidation Event> (assuming for this purpose that the <Proposed Sale> is a <Deemed Liquidation Event>) in accordance with the <Company>'s <Restated Charter> in effect immediately prior to the <Proposed Sale>.
Participation Right \\
    General \\ Each <Major Purchaser> has the right of first refusal to purchase the <Major Purchaser>'s <Pro Rata Share> of any <New Securities> (as defined below) that the <Company> may from time to time issue after the date of the <Agreement>, provided, however, the <Major Purchaser> will have no right to purchase any such <New Securities> if the <Major Purchaser> cannot demonstrate to the <Company>'s reasonable satisfaction that such <Major Purchaser> is at the time of the proposed issuance of such <New Securities> an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D under the <Securities Act>. A <Major Purchaser>'s ""Pro Rata Share"" means the ratio of
        \\ the number of shares of the <Company>'s <Common Stock> issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> owned by such <Major Purchaser>, to
        \\ the <Fully-Diluted Share Number>.
    New Securities \\ ""New Securities"" means any <Common Stock> or <Preferred Stock>, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase <Common Stock> or <Preferred Stock>, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible or exchangeable into <Common Stock> or <Preferred Stock>; provided, however, that "<New Securities>" does not include:
        \\ shares of <Common Stock> issued or issuable upon conversion of any outstanding shares of <Preferred Stock>;
        \\ shares of <Common Stock> or <Preferred Stock> issuable upon exercise of any options, warrants, or rights to purchase any securities of the <Company> outstanding as of the <Agreement Date> and any securities issuable upon the conversion thereof;

        \\ shares of the <Company>'s <Series Next Preferred Stock> issued pursuant to the <Agreement>;
        \\ any other shares of <Common Stock> or <Preferred Stock> (and/or options or warrants therefor) issued or issuable primarily for other than equity financing purposes and approved by the <Board>; and

    Procedures \\ If the <Company> proposes to undertake an issuance of <New Securities>, it shall give notice to each <Major Purchaser> of its intention to issue <New Securities> (the ""Notice""), describing the type of <New Securities> and the price and the general terms upon which the <Company> proposes to issue the <New Securities>.

    Failure to Exercise \\ If the <Major Purchasers> fail to exercise in full the right of first refusal within the 10-day period, then the <Company> will have 120 days thereafter to sell the <New Securities> with respect to which the <Major Purchasers>' rights of first refusal hereunder were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the <Company>'s <Notice> to the <Major Purchasers>. If the <Company> has not issued and sold the <New Securities> within the 120-day period, then the <Company> shall not thereafter issue or sell any <New Securities> without again first offering those <New Securities> to the <Major Purchasers> pursuant to {Participation Right}.
Election of Board of Directors \\
    Voting; Board Composition \\ Subject to the rights of the stockholders to remove a director for cause in accordance with applicable law, during the term of the <Agreement>, each <Stockholder> shall vote (or consent pursuant to an action by written consent of the stockholders) all shares of capital stock of the <Company> now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned of record or beneficially by the <Stockholder> (the ""Voting Shares""), or to cause the <Voting Shares> to be voted, in such manner as may be necessary to elect (and maintain in office) as the members of the <Board>:

        Series Next Board Members \\ that number of individuals, if any, equal to the <Series Next Board Member Count> (each, a ""Series Next Board Designee"") designated from time to time in a writing delivered to the <Company> and signed by <Purchasers> who then hold a majority of the then-outstanding shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> issued pursuant to the <Agreement>;
        \\ that number of individuals, if any, equal to the <Mutual Consent Board Member Count> (together with any <Common Board Designee> and any <Series Next Board Designee>, each a ""Board Designee"") designated from time to time in a writing delivered to the <Company> and signed by
            \\ <Purchasers> who then hold a majority of the then-outstanding shares of <Series Next Preferred Stock> issued pursuant to the <Agreement> and

        \\ fails to vote or

    The proxy and power granted by each <Stockholder> pursuant to {Election of Board of Directors} are coupled with an interest and are given to secure the performance of the <Stockholder>'s duties under the <Agreement>. Each such proxy and power will be irrevocable for the term of the <Agreement>. The proxy and power, so long as any <Stockholder> is an individual, will survive the death, incompetency and disability of such <Stockholder> and, so long as any <Stockholder> is an entity, will survive the merger or reorganization of the <Stockholder> or any other entity holding <Voting Shares>.
