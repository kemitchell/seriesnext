Disclosure Schedule
===================

See next page. If no next page, then there are no disclosures.

This Disclosure Schedule (this "**Disclosure Schedule**") is delivered by the Company in connection with the sale of shares of the Company's Series Next Preferred Stock on or about the Agreement Date by the Company. This Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in Exhibit B of the Agreement, and the disclosures in any section of this Disclosure Schedule qualify other sections in Exhibit B of the Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections. Where any representation or warranty is limited or qualified by the materiality of the matters to which the representation or warranty are given, the inclusion of any matter in this Disclosure Schedule does not constitute an admission by the Company that such matter is material. Unless otherwise defined herein, any capitalized terms in this Disclosure Schedule have the same meanings assigned to those terms in the Agreement. Nothing in this Disclosure Schedule constitutes an admission of any liability or obligation of the Company to any third party, or an admission against the Company's interests.
